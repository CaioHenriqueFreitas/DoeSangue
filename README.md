# DoeSangue
Project about blood donation, I was responsible for the back-end code

In literal translation, Doe Sangue means "Give Blood", that initiave was proposed by the physics professor Carlos Renato Zacharias. He 
thought that, one of the reasons that people don't donate blood is because of the long queues and restrictions. So he organized this 
project in order to gather more blood from the students and employes at university, by making the process more easy. Me and Hector (his son, that was studying computer science back then) was responsible for constructing a website that was easy to use and that showed all the pre-requisites for the blood donation. I was responsible for organizing the database structure using PHP and SQL.
